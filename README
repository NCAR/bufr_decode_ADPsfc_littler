Description and instructions to use the included extraction program:
=================================================================================

These individual programs can be used to extract general 
atmospheric variables from adp BUFR files into simple text 
files.  

** DATATSET files PRIOR to March 21, 2000 to be 
   decoded on big-endian machines
   need to be blocked using the cwordsh NCEP utility
   located in the blk_ublk directory.
   The README file within that directory            
   describes the process. *****

** All Files to be decoded on little-endian linux machines must first
   be processed through the "grabbufr/grabbufr.sh" script, with
   the resulting output used as input for the decoders. **

To compile the BUFR libraries and extraction code, go to the 
install directory.  Set the CPLAT variable in the install/install.sh 
script to reflect the correct platform.  Currently CPLAT=linux.
Execute the install.sh script to complete the compilations.

The executables will be placed in the exe directory.  Execute
the desired executable and enter the BUFR input file name to extract
the basic meteorological varibles into text format.  A file named
bufrtext.out will be created containing the text data.

exe/bufr_sfc2ob.x:  used to convert gdas.adpsfc.tHHz.YYYYMMDD.bufr files to obs format.
exe/bufr_ship2ob.x  used to convert gdas.sfcshp.tHHz.YYYYMMDD.bufr files  to obs format.
exe/runob2lit_imd_obs.x  used to convert/combine obs format files into one littlr format file.
exe/files.txt  edit to include desired obs files to be input into the runob2lit_imd_obs.x program.
               example files are currently listed in the files.txt file.

** To convert muliple files, place input BUFR data in "bufrdecodelr/bufrobs",
and edit and run the exe/convert.csh script accordingly. **
